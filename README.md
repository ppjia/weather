#Coding Challenge

##Summary

Welcome to the William Hill iOS Challenge.

We would like you to create a small mobile application.

Please code the application in Swift

The task we would like you to complete is to create a basic app that makes a call to a weather (RESTful) web service, and display the data that is returned in the response on the screen of the mobile app, changing the interface (UI) according to the forecast being returned (clear, sunny, raining, etc.). The app only needs to make a single call at launch.

Some key elements we will be looking for in the application are:

* Use of suitable design patterns, and a strict separation of concerns when developing a mobile application
* Information about multiple days forecast shown on the screen  
* At least one user interaction (such as scrolling or tapping to get more info)
* Correct use of the application life cycle, management of the UI thread, and async development principals when displaying data and making network calls
* Unit tests/mocks to demonstrate the code is testable

##Getting Started  
*	Register for a free API key for darksky.net
*	The API to query is https://api.darksky.net/forecast/{Your_API_key_here}/{latitude},{longitude} | Sydney lat & lon: 33.8650, 151.2094  
*	Use of frameworks, libraries, and open-source code is allowed, but please reference their use in comments in the code. Please use package management for open source dependencies where suitable.  

When complete, please submit a pull request, and provide read access of your forked repo to:
